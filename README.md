On first clone, run `install.sh`.
Select `y` for all expo features. (May want to have emulators open).

To clean install:
1. `expo upgrade`
2. delete node_modules
3. delete `package-lock.json`
4. `npm install`

Or run `install.sh` again....

## TODO
* App settings
* Text scale setting
* Background image
* Gear image
* Spinner icons?
